### Desc
On a distant planet lays a group. They are immigrants to a new land not of Earth. Their goal is to arrive at a new spot of land and terraform the space to be inhabitable. You job is to oversee these immigrants to their new home. There is the a twist though. The local TSA has been less than kind to people in general much less immigrants. The TSA isn't the only thing on Mars to keep you company. Try to see them through thick and thin whether them natural or unatural. Dysentery is a really big problem too.
