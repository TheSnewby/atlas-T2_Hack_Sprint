There outside the ship is the beutiful red planes of the planet Mars - like a desert but only with more heat and even less life. The sun beats down on the scourched ground. The air sizzles or what little of it there is. Mars having no atmosphere makes it hard to live on but not impossible. With the latest technology developed back on Earth, terraforming the red planet was no longer just a pipe dream. Settlers in droves loaded up on seedships to travel to Mars. Even with technology, it's money that runs the world. These people don't even live on the world anymore so they could only afford a seedship to the red planet. Having disembarked the ship, many smaller ships set off across the red planes. On one of those little ships that has set up camp ... is you.
