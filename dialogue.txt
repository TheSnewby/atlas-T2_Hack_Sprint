Even with technology, it's money that runs the world. These people don't even live on the world anymore so they could only afford a seedship to the red planet. Having disembarked the ship, droves of smaller ships set of across the red plane. One of those little ships has set up camp or as close to a camp you can get to in this day and age. Suddenly there is a red pentagram appears on the gournd next the the camping group. What is you reaction?
